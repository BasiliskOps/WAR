# WAR

To play, each player reveals the top card in their cut of the deck. The player, who draws the card with the higher rank (Aces high), takes the revealed cards and puts them at the bottom of their deck half in an arbitrary order.
If both players are to draw a card holding the same value, then they must go to WAR!! Once such condtions are met, each player draws the top three cards of their deck halves, face down, and then each player reveals the top card once more. A clear victor is the one that wins upon the second reveal... thereby taking all of the cards. If there is another stalemate, the war rages on, until there is a winner.
